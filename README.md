# üöÄ Stock & News Insights App üìà

Welcome to the **Stock & News Insights App** ‚Äì a powerful tool built to provide **real-time stock data** and the **latest news headlines** for any company using its ticker symbol. This project, housed in the repository `finance_project`, is tailored for developers, investors, and finance enthusiasts, combining ease of use, reliable data, and modern technologies to keep you informed about the stock market! üìäüíº

---

## üéØ What Does the App Do?

The **Stock & News Insights App** serves three key purposes:

1. **Fetch Stock Data:**
   - Retrieve the last **5 days of stock data** (open, high, low, close, and volume) for any company using its ticker symbol.
   - Data is queried live using **Yahoo Finance** and stored in a **PostgreSQL** database for fast retrieval.

2. **Fetch Latest News:**
   - Fetch the **top 5-10 latest news articles** related to the company's ticker symbol.
   - News data is sourced live using **Yahoo Finance** and stored in a **MongoDB** database to ensure scalability and fast reads.

3. **Interactive Chat for Analysis:**
   - Leverage **OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API** to provide a natural language response for user queries based on stock data and news.
   - Users can ask questions like, *"What is the best day to invest?"* or *"Summarize the stock trends for the past week."* and get intelligent answers.

</a>

## üõ† Tech Stack

The application combines modern web technologies, APIs, and databases to deliver a seamless experience:

### Backend & APIs
- **Django**: The core framework for building the backend API.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Enables creating RESTful APIs for fetching and serving stock/news data.
- **yfinance**: Fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Selenium**: Scrapes live news headlines using a headless browser configured with a proxy.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Parses the scraped Yahoo Finance page to extract clean news content.
- **Requests**: Handles API calls and proxy connections to external data sources.

### Databases
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores historical stock data for persistence and efficient querying.
- **MongoDB**: Saves news articles, ensuring a scalable and document-based solution.

### AI Integration
- **OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-Turbo)**: Provides intelligent, human-like responses to questions about stock trends and news insights.

### UI & User Interaction
- **Gradio**: A powerful UI library that creates a user-friendly, interactive web interface for:
   - Viewing stock summaries, charts, and tables.
   - Fetching news headlines.
   - Asking questions using an AI-powered chatbot.
- **Matplotlib**: Generates stock price charts for visualization.

### Proxy & Browser Automation
- **PacketStream Proxy**: Ensures dynamic IPs for scraping news content without getting blocked.
- **ChromeDriver + Selenium Options**: Runs a headless browser in the background for smooth scraping.

## üß© How It Works

### 1. **Stock Data Retrieval** üóÇÔ∏è
- The user inputs a **stock ticker symbol** (e.g., `AAPL`, `TSLA`, `MSFT`).
- A request is sent to the **Django API**, which queries the **Yahoo Finance API** (via `yfinance`).
- The retrieved stock data (5 days of historical data) is stored in a **PostgreSQL** database.
- The backend then returns:
   - A **stock summary** in human-readable format using OpenAI's GPT API.
   - A **stock price chart** plotted using Matplotlib.
   - A tabular format of stock data for detailed insights.

### 2. **News Retrieval** üì∞
- The user queries for news related to the company's ticker symbol.
- **Selenium** (with a proxy) navigates to Yahoo Finance News and extracts the latest headlines using **BeautifulSoup**.
- The parsed news is saved in **MongoDB** to ensure future requests are faster.
- The backend returns a list of top 5-10 **news headlines**, including:
   - **Title** of the news.
   - **Link** to the full article.
   - **Date** of publication.

### 3. **Interactive Chat** üí¨
- Users can ask questions in natural language, like:
   - *"What are the stock trends for this week?"*
   - *"Summarize the latest news headlines for this company."*
- The app combines **stock data** and **news data** into a single dataset.
- OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API processes the data and provides an insightful, conversational response.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Workflow

1. **Frontend (Gradio):**
   - Users interact with a simple and intuitive UI.
   - Provides inputs (e.g., ticker symbols, questions) and fetches outputs (stock charts, summaries, and news).

2. **Backend (Django + DRF):**
   - Handles requests from Gradio.
   - Fetches and processes stock and news data.
   - Uses OpenAI API for natural language processing.

3. **Databases:**
   - **PostgreSQL** for structured stock data.
   - **MongoDB** for unstructured news articles.

4. **External Tools:**
   - **yfinance** for stock data.
   - **Selenium + BeautifulSoup** for news scraping.

---

## üî• Features

1. **Dynamic Stock Data:**
   - Retrieve accurate and up-to-date stock data with charts and tables.

2. **Real-Time News Headlines:**
   - Fetch the latest company news dynamically using Selenium with proxy support.

3. **AI-Powered Chat:**
   - Get smart, concise insights and summaries using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API.

4. **Interactive UI:**
   - Use Gradio for seamless interaction with stock data, news, and the AI chatbot.
